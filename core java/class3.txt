Comments in Java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Diagram : class3.1

Comments will not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1) Single Line Comment 
---------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple Line Comment 
------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

ex:
---
//class declaration 
class Test
{

	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int x = 10;

		//output stmt
		System.out.println(x); 
	}
}


Project 
========
It is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim/goal.

Technically, a project is a collection of modules.

We have following list of modules.

ex:
	registration module 
	login module 
	admin module 
	payment module 
	report generation module 
	and etc.	

Every project contains two domains.

1) Technical Domain 
------------------
	Technical domain describes using which technology we developed our project.
	ex:
		Java

2) Functional Domain 
------------------
	Functional domain describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain 
		Banking domain 
		ERP domain 
		Insaurance domain 
		and etc.

Interview Questions
===================

Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?

JDK 
-----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

JDK is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar) , document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE 
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It is a part of a JDK that provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
---
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
It is a part of a JRE that is used to execute our program line by line procedure.

Java consider as platform independent at byte code level.
Java is also known as WORA i.e Write Once Run Anywhere.
